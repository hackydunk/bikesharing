# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 
This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.

What is the population of Des Moines? How does its population compare to the population of New York City? Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?

The population of Des Moines is 216,853 as of July, 1st 2019.  The population of Des Moines is significantly lower than the population of New York City.  The overall number of people that will use the bike-sharing program will increase, but nothing stands out in terms of percentage increases. To clarify I believe that the population soley does not have an effect on the percentage of total people that participate in the bike-sharing program.

Some things that might positively impact the Des Moine bike sharing program.
1. Des Moines has a neat downtown area with tourist attractions and a farmers market. Things like this are fun to explore by bicylce.
2. Des Moines also has "High Trestle Trail" which could attract increased bike users.

It is worth noting that Des Moine already has a bicycle sharing/renting program known as "Des Moine Bicycle Collective". Competition can be good or bad, but will be further revealed by additional research.

Taking a look at the Tableau dashboard you can see that NYC has a distribution of riders closer to the heart of the city. Riders usually pick up bikes around 8am and 5pm. That indicates that riders use the bikes to commute to and from work.

In addtion to that, the bikes are used heavily. The gender and age breakdown indicate usage across all ages and genders, but I don't see a major difference in use cases between New York City and Des Moine.

Overall I would not recommend investment into a Des Moine bikesharing program. I don't believe Des Moine has the population density need for a successful program.
